Issue Summary:

Duration of Outage: The outage started at 12:45 AM and was resolved by 04:40 AM.

12:45 PM: Issue detected with automated monitoring alerts showing increased response time.
01:15 AM: The engineering team was notified of the slowdown via an automated alert.
02:10 AM: Initial investigation started, focusing on database and server health.
02:30 AM: Assumed database overload due to increased traffic; scaling attempts initiated.
03:00 AM: No improvement observed; wrong assumption led to ineffective scaling measures.
03:15 AM: The issue escalated to the senior engineering team for further investigation.
03:30 AM: Intensive analysis revealed a misconfigured caching layer causing database queries to bottleneck.
04:00 AM: Caching layer reconfiguration initiated.
04:40 AM: Web stack performance restored; platform functionality back to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: A misconfigured caching layer resulted in a flood of unnecessary database queries, overwhelming the system.
Resolution: The caching layer was reconfigured to filter and cache appropriate queries, reducing the load on the database and restoring normal performance.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Strengthen monitoring to detect abnormal query patterns in real time.
Regularly review and update system configurations to prevent misconfigurations.
Implement automated testing for caching layer configurations during deployment.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement stricter access controls for configuration changes to prevent accidental misconfigurations.
Conduct a thorough review of existing caching mechanisms to identify and eliminate potential bottlenecks.
Enhance documentation regarding system dependencies and configurations for better future troubleshooting.
Schedule regular training sessions to keep the team updated on best practices for web stack maintenance and troubleshooting.
